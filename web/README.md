# Fournal front-end

The simple front-end made using gatsby. So simple, making me overthink things.

Went with a less than optimal routing to start with - been pondering too much 🤷🏻‍♂️. 


## Todo
- [] Refactor 😉 optimize
- [] Possibly break off querys (fragments) to external files
- [] "Smarter" querries?
